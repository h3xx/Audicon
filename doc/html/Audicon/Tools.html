<h1><a name="name">NAME</a></h1>
<p>Audicon::Tools - a collection of simple functions to aid in the interpretation of FFT bin data.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>Many of the calculations performed by <em>Audicon</em> on a particular set of audio data require the deconstruction of the waveform of the audio into frequency/amplitude pairs. This module was created in order to deal with the deconstruction of the audio data in this fashion.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="preamble">Preamble</a></h2>
<p>First of all, audio is a sequence of micro-changes air pressure which are transmitted over distances and perceived by the human ear as sound. These air pressure variations can be expressed as a positive or negative value, depending on what increase or decrease beyond &quot;neutral&quot; air pressure is created:</p>
<pre>
 ^ | __        __        __
 + |/  \      /  \      /  \
  0|----\----/----\----/----\----
 - |     \  /      \  /      \  /
 v |      --        --        --
   time -&gt;</pre>
<p>Digital audio waveforms are merely a collection of values, in essence, between <code>-1</code> and <code>1</code>, inclusive, which are called <strong>samples</strong>. Samples represent what the air pressure will be at the point in time where the sample occurs. The rate at which the samples are converted to air pressure variations (&quot;playing&quot; the digital audio) is described as the <strong>sampling rate</strong>. The sampling rate is expressed in the number samples that represent one second of digital audio.</p>
<p>Through the graphing of the audio samples' values by time, we can see how they represent the original waveform:</p>
<pre>
 +1| ..        ..        ..
   |-  -      -  -      -  -
  0|----*----*----*----*----*----
   |     -  -      -  -      -  -
 -1|      --        --        --
   time -&gt;</pre>
<p>Because digital audio uses computerized values for the representation of these samples, the maximum height of a waveform is limited to <code>+/-1</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="language">Language</a></h2>
<p>Regarding the deconstruction of audio data, there are certain terms used in this document that require explanation:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="amplitude" class="item">amplitude</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>In sound, <strong>amplitude</strong> refers to the loudness of the waveform, also described as the amount of air pressure change that the waveform produces. In physical sound, it is measures in pascals. In digital sound, however it becomes a measure of its height within the limit of the samples' maximum value:</p>
<pre>
 +1| __        __        __.........._
   |/  \      /  \      /  \         |--- amplitude
  0|----\----/----\----/----\----....-
   |     \  /      \  /      \  /
 -1|      --        --        --
   time -&gt;</pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="frequency" class="item">frequency</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>A <strong>frequency</strong>, or pitch is an expression of how many times per second a given waveform completes its cycle, or <strong>period</strong>. It is expressed in <strong>Hz</strong>, or cycles per second.</p>
<pre>
      +---------+---------+------ peaks
      |         |         |
      v         v         v
 +1| __        __        __
   |/  \      /  \      /  \
  0|----\----/----\----/----\----.
   |     \  /      \  /      \  /.
 -1|      --        --        -- .
   time -&gt;                       .
   .                             .
   |----------1 second-----------|</pre>
<pre>
   3 peaks in 1 second =&gt; frequency: 3 Hz</pre>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="bin" class="item">bin</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>A <strong>frequency bin</strong>, or <strong>bin</strong>, means a summation of the amplitudes of all frequencies associated with that bin as they occur in the deconstructed waveform.</p>
<p>Frequency bins are an effective representation of the loudness, or <strong>amplitude</strong> of the musical notes, or <strong>tones</strong> present in a waveform.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="magnitude" class="item">magnitude</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Because higher-frequency waveforms carry more energy than lower-frequency ones, it becomes necessary to think of a waveform in terms of the total energy carried by it. The <strong>magnitude</strong> of a waveform is an expression of this. It is the amplitude of the waveform weighted by its frequency, and is found by multiplying its amplitude by its frequency.</p>
<p>The energy said to be carried by a given waveform is expressed as the total change in air displacement incurred by the transmission of that waveform. This can be found by finding the absolute derivative of the waveform.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="phase" class="item">phase</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>The <strong>phase</strong> of a given waveform refers to the point in its cycle at which it is first observed. It is typically measured in radians from 0 the value of theta would be in the waveform's sine function.</p>
<p>A simpler way of defining it would be to think of it in terms of how far the beginning of the period of the waveform is from the origin:</p>
<pre>
   +------ first period starts at the origin; no phasing
   |
   v
 +1| __        __        __
   |/  \      /  \      /  \
  0|----\----/----\----/----\----
   |     \  /      \  /      \  /
 -1|      --        --        --
   time -&gt;</pre>
<pre>
      +--- first period begins here
      |
   +------ began observing here (3/4 through last period)
   |  |        =&gt; phasing of +1/4 of a period = +pi/2
   v  v
 +1|    __        __        __
   |   /  \      /  \      /  \
  0|--/----\----/----\----/----\-
   | /      \  /      \  /      \

<h2><a name="the_fourier_transform">The Fourier Transform</a></h2>
<p>Joseph Fourier discovered that within complex waveforms exist many simpler waveforms with their own individual pitches. The Fourier transform was built as a way to decompose these complex waveforms into the simpler ones.</p>
<p>By design, the computerized Fourier transform gives a deconstruction of a waveform as a set of complex values, whose real and imaginary portions relate to one another in a way that it is possible to reconstruct the original waveform, complete with phased and non-phased waveforms.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the audio analysis performed by <em>Audicon</em>, the deconstuction is a one-way process. Therefore it becomes necessary to simplify the Fourier transform deconstruction's data in such a way that it is able to be processed in an ad hoc manner. That is what this module's purpose is.</p>

<p>This function also provides a method of combining both the real and imaginary portions of the Fourier transform into a dataset that represents the waveform in a standardized fashion, returning the same bin value for a particular frequency/amplitude combination regardless of whether it was phase-shifted when it occurred in the waveform.</p>

<h2><a name="fft_weighted">fft_weighted</a></h2>
<p>A weighted Fourier transform bin is equal to the value of the absolute amplitude of the waveform that bin represents, multiplied with the frequency associated to that bin. The result is a set of bins that are often referred to as representative of the magnitude of each component wave, as higher-frequency waves carry more energy than lower-frequency ones.</p>
<p>The returned array ref will be of similar complexity to the array of amplitudes passed in, which, as stated above, may contain one or both REAL or IMAGINARY bin vectors.</p>
<p>This function is designed to be used in conjunction with <a href="#fft_unweighted">fft_unweighted</a> and <a href="#associated_frequencies">associated_frequencies</a>.</p>
<pre>
        # calculate both real and imaginary portions at the same time
        # (@amps contains both REAL and IMAGINARY bin sets)
        my $mags = &amp;fft_weighted(\@amps, \@freqs);
        my ($mags_real, $mags_imag) = @{$mags};</pre>
<pre>
        # calculate real and imaginary portions separately
        my $mags_real = &amp;fft_weighted(\@amps_real, \@freqs);

<h2><a name="fft_all">fft_all</a></h2>
<p>Calculates all three (unweighted, weighted and associated frequencies) and returns a single hash with three keys, respectively <strong>'amps'</strong>, <strong>'mags'</strong> and <strong>'freqs'</strong>.</p>
<p>Optionally, a third option, <strong>'mode'</strong>, may be specified. This controls which set of data will be returned. Valid modes include <strong>'real'</strong>, <strong>'imag'</strong>, <strong>'both'</strong> for returning respectively the real, imaginary or both portions of the FFT bin values.</p>
<p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td>An alternative value for <strong>'mode'</strong> is <strong>'dist'</strong> which computes the distance from the origin of the point (REAL, IMAG). This is known as the Euclidian norm of the vector, which is characterized by the following function:
<tr><td><td>      __________________
<tr><td><td>     /                  ^

<p>where <strong>r</strong> is the real portion and <strong>i</strong> is the imaginary portion.</p>
<p>The default value is <strong>'dist'</strong>. This mode is recommended, as it has been tested to give the same resulting bin value for both phased and non-phased waveforms.</p>

<p>This module can be used directly, but is meant for use in <a href="../Audicon/Feature.html">the Audicon::Feature manpage</a>.</p>
<p>These subroutines, when used as part of the Audicon project, will be called with basically the same input arguments as a whole slew of others. This said, most of the calculations have been engineered to occur as far up the call stack as possible. As a result, these subroutines expect to have their data pretty well pre-processed.
