I don't care to think about how I was calculating bell curves before, but the
point I am making in this note is that I am a complete jerkoff; the correct way
to plot my demented implementation of bell curves is the following function:

y = he * %e ^ (-abs(((x - cn) / sc) ^ xp / wd));

instead of `y = he * %e ^ (-abs((x / sc - cn) ^ xp / wd))'

the latter function causes curves to appear centered around the line
`x = cn * sc' which is very bad and a very stupid mistake.

Well, it's fixed now.
