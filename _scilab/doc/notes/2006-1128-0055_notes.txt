SETTING AN ELEMENT OF A VECTOR TO [] *TRUNCATES* THAT VECTOR

(abs) fft()'s y-values are the computed TOTAL energy of wave cycling x times in dataset. I.E. amplitude * size(dataset) / 2.
* It would be a good idea to NORMALIZE fft()'s output with something like this:
	fftdata = abs(fft(wavdata));
	normedfft = fftdata * 2 / sampling_rate;
